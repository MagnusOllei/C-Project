This is a mini golf game made using ChatGPT and my own edits. To be honest, this was a really tough assignment ChatGPT is garbage at coding, because it is so unpredictable and you never know what code it will give you. Like, I'll have been in a conversation in C++ for an hour, and then it will just switch over to Python. Ridiculous. Anyway, this was the best version of the game I could come up with. Enjoy!
